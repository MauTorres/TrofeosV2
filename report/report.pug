  Next we will have a look at some differences between ReLaXed and other frameworks.

  ## ReLaXed vs other solutions

  Here are a few highlights of what you may win, or lose, using ReLaXed instead
  of another solution. This section is of course open to contributions.

  Let us start with Markdown. This widely supported language (Github, NPM, etc.)
  became very popular due to its simple and friendly syntax close to plain text.
  Markdown also has cool editors and extensions. One example is
  [``markdown-preview-enhanced``](https://atom.io/packages/markdown-preview-enhanced)
  which can render plots, flowcharts, and equations.

  ReLaXed has been specially extended so that it could support plot, flowchart,
  and equations (using the same underlying libraries as
  markdown-preview-enhanced), as illustrated in Figure 1. In addition, ReLaXed
  allows you to write any kind of layout with boxes, sidebars, etc. HTML
  elements are more fun to write with Pug (in markdown, HTML elements must be
  written in plain HTML). You can define macros, use conditionals and loops, use
  computed expressions using Javascript , and ReLaXed supports (S)CSS which is
  pretty cool. Last but not least, you can write parts in markdown if you want
  to <i class="em em-wink"></i> . Yep, that was an emoji. Cost us one line of
  code, to import [Emoji CSS](https://afeld.github.io/emoji-css/) as a
  stylesheet.

  Now what about LaTeX ? Sure, LaTeX is wide-spread in academic and publishing
  communities, where it's typography and layout optimizations, and its
  bibliography management tool are very appreciated. But LaTeX is also known for
  its cryptic errors, its complex advanced syntax which not many make the effort
  to learn, and as a consequence not many LaTeX venture on the creative side
  with their own themes and layouts.

  Certainly the letter and paragraph spacings won't be as nice in ReLaXed (but
  Google Chrome is still doing a very good job), but the syntax, clear error
  messages, etc. will certainly make  you happier. ReLaXed is also possibly
  faster to render big documents (not entirely sure though <i class="em
  em-thinking_face"></i>).
